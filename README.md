# IPR-TPR-Multiphase
This project analyzes IPR and TPR curves using the Poettmann and Carpenter method to evaluate multi-phase flow in vertical wells. Various tubing diameters were analyzed to identify the optimal size by determining the operating point where the curves intersect. Includes parameter calculations, pressure loss evaluation, and curve plotting.
